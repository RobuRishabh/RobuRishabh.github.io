The projectâ€™s main goal is to investigate real-time object detection and tracking of pedestrians or bicyclists using a Velodyne LiDAR Sensor. Various point-cloud-based algorithms are implemented using the Open3d python package. The resulting 3D point cloud can then be processed to detect objects in the surrounding environment.
