In classification problems, it’s crucial to have effective measures to evaluate how well our model is performing. Unlike regression, where measures like R² and mean squared error help assess model performance, classification tasks rely on other metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score due to the categorical nature of predictions.
